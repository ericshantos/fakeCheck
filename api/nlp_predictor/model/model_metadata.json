    "limitations": "This model was trained exclusively on Portuguese-language journalistic data from Brazil. It is not suitable for detecting irony, satire, or multimodal content (such as memes, images, or videos). It may exhibit bias towards topics and sources that are overrepresented in the training data. The model does not generalize well to informal language, social media slang, or regional dialects. It should not be used for legal, judicial, or high-stakes decision-making contexts.",
